Hey 👋 
I’m Harshit Kumar, a frontend developer from India.

I build interfaces, break them, and rebuild them until they feel right.

Mostly working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React —  
currently exploring backend basics and Node.js.

I learn by building, not rushing.

Outside code: anime and self-improvement.
